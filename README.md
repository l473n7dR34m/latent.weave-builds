## Blend your GIFs into new creations

latent.weave is a creative tool for mashing, blending and glitching GIFs together. Load two GIFs, pick your effects, and create something completely new and unexpected.

Made by [@latent.dream](https://linktr.ee/latent.dream) for GIF lovers, digital artists, and anyone who likes making weird visuals.

## What you can do with it

- Blend any two GIFs with multiple blend modes
- Apply up to 24 effects like Kaleidoscope, VHS, Datamosh, and Time Echo
- Stack multiple effects
- Adjust blend strength
- Rotate and flip GIFs
- Save your creations

## Included examples

The app comes with several demo GIFs to get you started:

- **gifA.gif & gifB.gif**: Basic demo files to quickly test different blend modes
- **example1.gif, example2.gif, example3.gif**: just some quick examples based on the demo files

## Installation

Just drag latent.weave to your Applications folder and you're good to go

## Getting started

1. Launch the app
2. Load GIF A & B
3. Experiment with different blend modes and effects
4. When you've created something cool, click the ðŸ’¾ button to save it

## Tips

- For best results, use GIFs around 400x400px
- Some effects look better when applied to just one of the GIFs (use the "Apply To" options)
- The slider controls blend strength and mix ratio between GIFs
- Try different rotations and flips for unexpected results
- The export framerate is currently locked to 12fps

## Requirements

- macOS 10.14 or newer

## On the roadmap

- Live feed to OBS
- More advanced effects
- Support for video files
- Additional blend modes

## Notes

This is my first app, so there might be a few bugs. If you run into any issues, please let me know!

Enjoy making weird GIF art! If you create something cool, I'd love to hear about it.
