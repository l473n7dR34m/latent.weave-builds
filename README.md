latent.weave is a creative tool for mashing, blending and glitching GIFs together. Load two GIFs, stack effects, and create something weird.

What you can do with it:

- Blend any two GIFs with 20+ blend modes
- Apply and stack 20+ effects like Kaleidoscope, VHS, Datamosh, and Time Echo
- Adjust blend strength
- Rotate and flip GIFs
- Save your creations

Getting started:

- Launch the app
- Load GIF A & B
- Experiment with different blend modes and effects
- When you've created something cool, save it :)

Tips:

- For best results, use GIFs around 400x400px
- Some effects look better when applied to just one of the GIFs (use the "Apply To" options)
- The slider controls blend strength and mix ratio between GIFs
- Try different rotations and flips 
- The export framerate is currently locked to 12fps

Requirements:

- macOS 10.12 or newer
- Windows 7 or newer

What should I add?

- Adaptive UI
- Live feed to OBS
- More advanced effects
- Effect parameter control
- Effect stacking order
- Support for video files
- Masking
- ?????

Notes:

I have no idea what i'm doing. If you run into any bugs or issues, please let me know. 

Enjoy making weird GIF art <3 If you create something cool, I'd love to hear about it.
